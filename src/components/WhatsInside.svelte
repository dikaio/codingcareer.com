      When we first started working on this project, our ambitions were pretty
      modest — take all of the
      <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/994601867987619840">
        tips and tricks we’ve shared on Twitter
      </a>
      , bundle them up into one resource, and put it out into the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the more time we put into planning it, the more we realized that we
      had an opportunity to create something better than that. Something that
      wasn’t just a book, but
      <strong>
        more like a complete survival kit for designing for the web
      </strong>
      .
    </p>

    <p>Here’s what we ended up with…</p>

    <h2 id="the-book">The Book</h2>

    <p>
      A beautiful PDF containing
      <strong>50 incredibly visual chapters</strong>
      spread across 200+ painstakingly typeset pages.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      This book contains
      <em>literally everything</em>
      we know about web design, distilled into short, easy to read chapters.
    </p>

    <p>You can check out the full table of contents here:</p>

    </p>

    <p>
      Every chapter is designed to be as independent as possible, so you can
      read them in almost any order. And if you want to sit down and read the
      whole thing at once, you’ll have no trouble getting through it in just a
      couple of hours.
    </p>

    <h2>Video Tutorials</h2>

    <p>
      The book will teach you a ton, but there are some things best learned by
      watching an expert do it themselves.
    </p>

    <div class="px-6">

    </div>

    <p>
      We’ve put together three in-depth video tutorials that walk through how to
      take all of the ideas in the book and apply them to three common UI design
      scenarios:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Designing a complex form interface</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Building a data-focused dashboard</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Styling a text-focused landing page</strong>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Each video is tightly edited and just the right pace, so there’s no wasted
      time watching me “hmm” and “uhh” my way around the design.
