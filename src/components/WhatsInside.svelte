      When we first started working on this project, our ambitions were pretty
      modest — take all of the
      <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/994601867987619840">
        tips and tricks we’ve shared on Twitter
      </a>
      , bundle them up into one resource, and put it out into the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the more time we put into planning it, the more we realized that we
      had an opportunity to create something better than that. Something that
      wasn’t just a book, but
      <strong>
        more like a complete survival kit for designing for the web
      </strong>
      .
    </p>

    <p>Here’s what we ended up with…</p>

    <h2 id="the-book">The Book</h2>

    <p>
      A beautiful PDF containing
      <strong>50 incredibly visual chapters</strong>
      spread across 200+ painstakingly typeset pages.
    </p>

    <div class="px-6">
      <img
        src="https://refactoring-ui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/landing/illustration-book-optimized.png"
        alt="" />
    </div>

    <p>
      This book contains
      <em>literally everything</em>
      we know about web design, distilled into short, easy to read chapters.
    </p>

    <p>You can check out the full table of contents here:</p>

    <p>
      <a href="/book/table-of-contents/">
        Check out the full table of contents
      </a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Every chapter is designed to be as independent as possible, so you can
      read them in almost any order. And if you want to sit down and read the
      whole thing at once, you’ll have no trouble getting through it in just a
      couple of hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      We hate books that repeat the same ideas over and over just to fill out
      the page count. This book is written a lot like our
      <a
        href="https://medium.com/refactoring-ui/7-practical-tips-for-cheating-at-design-40c736799886">
        blog posts
      </a>
      — every sentence is highlight-worthy.
    </p>

    <h2>Video Tutorials</h2>

    <p>
      The book will teach you a ton, but there are some things best learned by
      watching an expert do it themselves.
    </p>

    <div class="px-6">
      <img
        src="https://refactoring-ui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/landing/illustration-videos-optimized.png"
        alt="" />
    </div>

    <p>
      We’ve put together three in-depth video tutorials that walk through how to
      take all of the ideas in the book and apply them to three common UI design
      scenarios:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Designing a complex form interface</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Building a data-focused dashboard</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Styling a text-focused landing page</strong>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Each video is tightly edited and just the right pace, so there’s no wasted
      time watching me “hmm” and “uhh” my way around the design.
    </p>

    <h2>The Component Gallery</h2>

    <p>
      How many times have you found yourself looking at other apps to get ideas
      for things like button styles, form layouts, or navigation treatments?
      This has always been a huge pain point for us with our own work, so we
      built the component gallery to solve it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The component gallery is a huge resource of
      <strong>20+ component/layout categories</strong>
      , and
      <strong>200+ individual component styles</strong>
      .
    </p>

    <div class="px-6">
      <img
        src="https://refactoring-ui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/landing/illustration-gallery-optimized.png"
        alt="" />
    </div>

    <p>
      It includes medium-fidelity mockups of every idea we could think of, for
      every component we could think of, including things like:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Button styles</li>
      <li>Login page layouts</li>
      <li>Marketing page sections</li>
      <li>Card layouts</li>
      <li>Table styles</li>
      <li>Navigation layouts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>…and much, much more.</p>

    <p>
      You’ll never have to browse another site for layout inspiration again.
    </p>

    <h2>Color Palettes</h2>

    <p>
      If you’ve ever used an online color palette generator, you know that the
      five swatches they end up giving you are never enough to build out a real
      interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      We set out to solve this by handcrafting
      <strong>over a dozen comprehensive color palettes</strong>
      that include 10 shades for each included color, as well as an example UI
      showing how those colors are intended to be used:
    </p>

    <div class="px-6">
      <img
        src="https://refactoring-ui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/landing/illustration-colors-optimized.png"
        alt="" />
    </div>

    <p>
      We’ve also put together a huge library of individual color scales that you
      can use to curate your own palettes, without handpicking every single
      shade yourself.
    </p>

    <h2>Font Recommendations</h2>

    <p>
      Trying to pick the perfect font for a project is a nightmare. There are
      thousands of fonts to choose from, and trying to make an informed decision
      without seeing a particular font in the right context takes forever.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’ve put together a list of over 30 fonts we absolutely love, and broken
      it down across three categories: UI, headlines, and article copy.
    </p>

    <div class="px-6">
      <img
        src="https://refactoring-ui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/landing/illustration-fonts-optimized.png"
        alt="" />
    </div>

    <p>
      Each font is shown in an example UI for that category, so you can get a
      feel for exactly how it’s going to look where you intend to use it,
      without having to try each font yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’ve ever felt uneasy trying to choose a typeface, this is going to
      save you a ton of time.
    </p>

    <h2>Custom illustrated icons</h2>

    <p>
      Refactoring UI also includes a set of 200 beautifully illustrated SVG
      icons:
    </p>

    <div class="px-16 mb-8">
      <img
        src="https://refactoring-ui.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/landing/illustration-icons-optimized.png"
        alt="" />
    </div>

    <p>
      The SVGs are pre-optimized, and the colors can easily be customized to fit
      your branding with just CSS — no design tool knowledge required.
    </p>
