      Real Talk about Coding Careers
    </h2>
    <div class="section-intro single-col-max mx-auto mb-5">
      <p>
        Embarking on a new Coding Career is a scary proposition. There are
        thousands of tutorials helping you learn to code and get that first job.
        But nothing on how to take that technical skill and make a great career
        out of it!
      </p>
      <p>
        This stuff
        <em>matters.</em>
        When you're learning to code, you have to decide what to learn, how to
        learn it, and eventually
        <b>marketing yourself</b>
        as a developer convincingly enough to land that first job.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that's just the beginning! Then you still have to learn on the job,
        build strong working relationships with your colleagues, network outside
        your company, and earn the expertise and reputation to
        <b>succeed as a Senior Developer!</b>
        ðŸ˜±
      </p>
      <p>
        Your ability to manage your career has direct financial results. Even
        for early career devs, it is common for top quintile developers to make
        >2x more than the average dev. This disparity
        <em>increases</em>
        from there - That's
        <em>tens of thousands of dollars per year,</em>
        and
        <b>millions</b>
        over a career. Not pocket change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Money isn't everything. Maybe you want to have an impact in Open Source.
        Maybe you want to have influence at work. Maybe you just want an easier
        time
        <em>finding</em>
        work - not just spammy recruiter emails, but great employers and clients
        <b>
          <em>reaching out to you</em>
        </b>
        instead of vice versa. It's all the same skillset.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>And nobody talks about it!!!</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Deconstructing career success is a passion of mine. Throughout my own
        career change journey, I have been looking for common traits among top
        performers and trying to reverse engineer their formulas for success.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've applied them to my own career with great results. I went from going
        through FreeCodeCamp in 2017, starting my first dev job in 2018, to
        getting hired as a Senior Dev Advocate at AWS in 2020! ðŸŽ‰
      </p>
      <p>
        Although my situation will be different from yours, I think there are
        some Good Ideas that are simply universal. I think it's time we wrote
        them down. I think it's time our industry had a real conversation about
        how to build an exceptional Coding Career. I'd like to tell you all I
        know.

      The Missing Manual for Early Career Devs
    </h2>

      <p>
        <em>Don't read this book in one sitting!</em>
        <b>The Coding Career Handbook</b>
        is specifically designed to be a nonlinear reference you can constantly
        revisit over the 4-8 years of your journey from Code Newbie to Senior
        Dev. That's why it comes in 4 parts:
      </p>
      <div class="row text-center">
        <Guides />
        <Principles />
        <Strategies />
        <Tactics />
      </div>

      That makes this book a very different kind of experience than most others:

      Continue the Conversation
    </h2>
    <div class="section-intro single-col-max mx-auto mb-5">

        The book is a conversation *starter* - it is far from the final word
        on how to build a successful coding career! **The Coding Career Community**
        is a moderated Discord chat where you can talk with other readers about
        the ideas from the book, ask questions, give criticism, find collaborators,
        and generally use as a friendly resource as you build your coding career.

        <img src="/codingcommunity-960.jpg" alt="screenshot of Community Discord" class="img-fluid" />

        Ever feel like you didn't have anyone outside work to talk to about your career?
        Here's a dedicated space where you can do exactly that, with like minds who
        have gone down the same road you have.

        *Note: Participating in the Discord is subject to a Code of Conduct,
        and your questions are not guaranteed to be answered. This is a new community
        and therefore there is a lot left to figure out!*

      Live & Recorded Workshops
    </h2>
    <div class="section-intro single-col-max mx-auto mb-5">

        **Get the most** out of your Coding Career journey with monthly live workshops.
        Dive deeper into selected topics from the book and others that didn't make the cut (yet!).
        Ask questions and get answers live, with the option to remain anonymous.

        <img src="/mocktalks_960.jpg" alt="screenshot of Workshops" class="img-fluid" />

        All workshops will be recorded, so this becomes an ever-growing library of career content.
        **If you are interested in being a guest speaker, please get in touch!**

        *Note: At least 4 sessions are planned but none are scheduled yet. Scheduling will take
        place over Discord chat and email. Standalone workshops are available for bootcamps and small teams.*
