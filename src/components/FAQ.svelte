          Totally! Click the "Generate" button on your receipt from Gumroad
          after you purchase and you can generate a detailed invoice with any

          The book, component gallery, color palettes, and font recommendations
          are PDFs, the screencasts are downloadable mp4 files, and the icons

        Does the component gallery include CSS?

      <div class="lg:w-2/3 lg:pl-6 text-teal-300 leading-normal">
        <p class="mb-6">Short answer is no.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Long answer is that the goal with the component gallery is to provide
          layout and treatment ideas with just enough fidelity to be useful.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          If you need an idea for a pricing page layout, the idea is that you'd
          browse the component gallery to find one you like, then combine that
          with what you learn from the book to create a great-looking design
          yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a million ways you could style these components, and we
          don't want the component gallery to encourage you to make every
          project look the same.

          TL;DR: Do pretty much whatever you want with them, including using
          them in open-source projects. Just don't resell them or publish them
          on npm purely to distribute them for free or anything lame like that.
