            Ever feel like you didn‚Äôt have anyone outside work to talk to about
            your career? Here‚Äôs a dedicated space where you can do exactly that!
            <strong>The Coding Career Community</strong>
            is a moderated Discord chat where you can talk with other readers
            about the ideas from the book and more. Ask questions, give criticism, find
            collaborators, and generally use as a friendly resource as you build
            your coding career.
          </p>
          <p class="text-base leading-6 text-gray-600 mt-2">
            Note: Participation in the Community is subject to a Code of
            Conduct, and your questions are not guaranteed to be answered.
            <strong>This is a new community</strong>
            and therefore there is a lot left to figure out!
